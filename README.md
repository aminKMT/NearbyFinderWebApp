* What is THERE?
Imagine you and a group of friends want to dine out and are looking for the nearest restaurant that serves a specific cuisine, like Indian. In this scenario, THERE can assist you in identifying potential dining spots and calculating the travel time for each of your friends, taking into account various factors such as mode of transportation (driving, public transportation), departure time, etc. In essence, THERE is a web application designed for optimizing location choices using Google API. It can be particularly useful in the logistics sector, enabling companies to pinpoint the nearest retailers or supermarkets relative to the diverse locations of their warehouses or manufacturing plants

* How does it work?
1. Insert your Google API Key in the "API Input" tab, and press next. Please note that your API Key wont be stored.
2. In the "API Input" tab, input your desired search term, such as Indian Cuisine or supermarket, into the "Search" section.

3. Enter your addresses in the address bar and use the "Add" button to include them in your inputs.
